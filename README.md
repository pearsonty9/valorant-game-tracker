#### Setup

1. Make sure you have python installed
2. Set up a python virtual environment
    1. This helps with managing python packages for this project without the need to install packages globally on your system
    2. To setup run `python3 -m venv venv`
        1. This creates a folder called venv in your current directory which stores the files for the packages we need to install
3. Activate the virtual environment if it is not already active, usually has some text inside parenthesis on the command line i.e. '(venv)'
4. Install projects packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - This will install the list of packages inside the requirements file to your virtual environment so they can be used when running the project

#### Running the Project

1. Run `python3 main.py` inside the root directory (i.e. the folder the project is in)
